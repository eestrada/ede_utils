EDE Utils
=========

A number of utilities I find I use rather often. Most are simple things, like making linked lists indexable, or defining a stream object that doesn't do anything (null stream). Some code is also my attempts to re-implement classes from the standard library for my own educational benefit. I have posted online them for my own convenience, and on the off chance they will be useful to someone else.

All code is placed in the public domain, and as such is provided without expressed or implied warranty.
